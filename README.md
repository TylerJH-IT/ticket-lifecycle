<p>

<h3> Step 2 Creating a ticket</h3>

Now we'll be clicking open a new ticket and type out something like...

- Karen(@)osticket.com
- Karen Karen
- Business Critical Outage
- Entire Mobile Banking system is down
- Customers are reporting that they are getting a 404 error when browsing to online banking.

</p>
<p>
<p>

<h3>Step 3: Accessing the ticket</h3>

- Sign in to osTicket as an agent.
  - We created Jane Doe in the previous tutorial so we'll log in with those credentials.
  - Now select the ticket we created in step 1

</p>
<p>

<h3>Step 4: Assignment and Communication part 1</h3>

- We'll set the Priority to Emergency as mobile online banking being down can lead to losses in revenue for the company and others that use it.

</p>
<p>

<h3>Step 5: Assignment and Communication part 2 </h3>

- We'll now be setting the SLA plan to SEV-A as this is a business impacting incident.

</p>
<p>

<h3> Step 6: Assignment and Communication part 3</h3>

- Now we'll be assigning this ticket to Jane Doe as that's who's account we're using to reply to this ticket.

</p>
<p>

<h3> Step 7: Assignment and Communication part 4</h3>

- Next we'll be assigning the System Administrators Department to this ticket as they are responsible for mobile banking infrastructure.

</p>
<p>

<h3> Step 8: Assignment and Communication part 5</h3>

- Finally we'll be sending a reply to this ticket saying "Coordinating with System Admin Team to bring mobile banking back online immediately."

<p>

</p>
<p>

<h3>Step 9: Resolution</h3>

- Once the issue is resolved head back to the ticket and update the end user.
  - Send another reply, something like.
  - "Kent from System Engineering found and connected a failed load balancer. Mobile Banking should now be back and running properly."
- And now that the 'issue' has been resolved, the ticket should now be put on the closed tab.

</p>
<p>

<h3> Step 10: Removing the VM</h3>
Now that we're done using this VM we'll be deleting it and our Resource Group, as keeping them around when not needed will take from our funds.
